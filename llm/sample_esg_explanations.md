The Eco-Drive Housing Unit recorded a total lifecycle carbon footprint of 12.4 kg CO₂e.
Scope-3 emissions represented approximately 67% of total emissions, primarily driven by raw material sourcing.

A material substitution from virgin ABS plastic to a certified bio-polymer reduced lifecycle emissions by 14.8%.
Residual emissions risks remain linked to supplier data variability and logistics assumptions.
